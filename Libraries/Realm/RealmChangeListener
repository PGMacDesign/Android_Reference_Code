/*
The RealmChangeListener is a very useful tool that takes an action (of your choosing) upon a change to the database. 
Below is a sample class that is using some basic code to define the RealmChangeListner.
Essentially, whenever the DB is changed (Delete, enter new entry, update, etc) it will make a toast to the user that 
says "Database updated". This has a myriad of uses but I think my favorite one is utilizing interfaces to change 
other aspects of your application.

        made to create it.
