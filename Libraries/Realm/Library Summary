/*
This library is mostly used for database setup. It performs most of the low level operations and allows you to not focus so 
much on DB nuances and just write insert, delete, update, and retrieve queries.

Include this in the .build file:
    compile 'io.realm:realm-android:0.81.1'
    //Database Management Library. Check link here for details: https://realm.io/docs/java/latest/#installation
