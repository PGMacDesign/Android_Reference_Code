/*
This is useful for making a class that returns a context instance of your application. 
I wrote about it in more detail on my blog here: https://pgmacdesign.wordpress.com/2015/07/14/android-myapplication-and-context/
There is one more bit of code which goes into your manifest, which I will include at the bottom
*/

public class MyApplication extends Application { 
 
    private static MyApplication sInstance;
 
    public static MyApplication getInstance() {
        return sInstance;
    }
 
    public static Context getAppContext() {
        return sInstance.getApplicationContext();
    }
 
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        sInstance = this;
    }
}

//This next part goes into your Manifest file. It is required, though options like allowBackup are not.
//The name has the path leading to the myApplication class within your packages.
<application
    android:name=".misc.MyApplication"
    android:allowBackup="true"
    android:icon="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
    android:label="@string/app_name"
    android:theme="@style/AppTheme" >
