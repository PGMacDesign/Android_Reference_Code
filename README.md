Android_Reference_Code
======================

This is a compilation of all of my best android practices/ snippets of code. They will all be separated by separate .java files

Things I will include:
1) Java Files
2) XML Files
3) Templates
4) Groupings of related sections (IE JSON Parsing / Storage systems)

XML Templates (They will be in folders) are on the way!
